# Boson-Z-Mass
University project for the Univesity of  Manchester using Python. Calculate the mass, width and lifetime of the Bosson Z using CERN data. It first reads in data from two different files and combines them. Before combining
it validates  and cleans the data. 
<br/>It proceeds by doing a minimised chi-squared fit to the data by varying two parameters simultaneously. With this fit it compares it to the data and removes the noise.
It then produces another minimised chi squared fit and returns the fitted parameters. Finally, it calculates the reduced chi-squared and the lifetime of the boson.
